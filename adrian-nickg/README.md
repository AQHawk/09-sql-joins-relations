# SQL Joins and Relations, Lab 9

**Authors**: Adrian Hawk & Nick Gibson
**Version**: 1.1.0

## Overview
A blogging web app that allows for SQL database storage, creation, deletion and retrieval of articles, rather than JS data arrays, localStorage as JSON, or other methods.

## Getting Started
Navigate a browser to the index.html file!

## Architecture
The site runs on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on the front end, and relies on a SQL server for back-end data (blog articles) storage/retrieval/updating through a nodeJS controller.

## Change Log
11/5/17 10:45PM: Creation of READEME.md; housekeeping in GitHub; ready for final push with updated SQL from weekend work.

11/3/17 1:50PM: Initial PR to document progress and submit to canvas as per instructions.

## Credits and Collaborations
All glory to the hypnotoad!
